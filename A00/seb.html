**A00 - Comparing Languages**

This is a sample write up for the A00_LanguageComparison assignment.


<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Prime Partitions
=================

42 has 15 prime partitions, and they are...

2 + 3 + 5 + 13 + 19,

2 + 3 + 7 + 11 + 19,

2 + 3 + 7 + 13 + 17,

2 + 3 + 37,

2 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 17,

2 + 11 + 29,

2 + 17 + 23,

3 + 5 + 11 + 23,

3 + 7 + 13 + 19,

5 + 7 + 11 + 19,

5 + 7 + 13 + 17,

5 + 37,

11 + 31,

13 + 29,

19 + 23,


Implementations
================


Language: Ada
--------------------------------

The implementation in ADA went interestingly. Dylan and I's first strategy was proven to be quite ineffective. One key reason for this was
that we had intended to use an array of array of partitions but realized we couldn't set the max size for this and so our thought to use
booleans for each array was ineffective. This is because the bound for # of distinct prime partitions is quite large and would way overallocate
space and overall be an ineffective solution. Interestingly, I found out that there is a new asymptotic bound on the number of prime partitions
as per a research paper from I think 2022 which was really cool to see given I have a big interest in combinatorics. Although we didn't end up
using this information, it was pretty cool to find it out and read that paper seeing if we could implement it.

This was Dylan's language to do but I'm interested as to why he chose Ruby and not Jscript given Jscript is so simple. Either way, it reminds me of a

Language: Prolog
--------------------------------

Wow this language is really weird and really cool. I'd never seen logic programming like this before. It's extremely peculiar to write
functions as definitions in the manner that this seems to require. It's almost like writing a ruleset for a game instead of coding. It feels
very different to use and looks somewhat funny (I don't find Prolog to be very readable) but how it works is really cool. I had a little
trouble with the defining primes weirdly at first and also some issues with printing at points, other than that it took some time but wasn't
too bad.

The languages are all somewhat different. I see quite a few similarities between the code in Haskell/Scheme and Ruby/C# but Prolog and Ada are
very different from the rest. I didn't realize quite how hard translating code can be, especially when languages are stylistically entirely
different. Coding in Prolog for instance felt nothing like what I usually do in, say, python.

My favorite was Prolog (probably) because it was just so novel. I didn't code in Scheme but after reading Dylan's that one is definitely
my least favorite (LOL).

I can imagine Prolog being really really good for algorithmic and mathematical work because its so logical and 'step by step' in a way. It
is a little tricky to get used to but it seems very effective for mathematical stuff.

Ruby and C# (as is to be expected) seem best for more general coding, software engineering and website development.

I don't know what I'd use Ada for (probably not much) but apparently it was developed by the DoD so that's pretty cool.

I Didn't do the one's that gave an option but I have absolutely no clue why Dylan chose ruby instead of Jscript. C# I also would have chosen
because I have a lot of experience in C and so I feel as if C# would be easy to pick up because I've already worked with its basis. 

We tried to split up the work based on which languages were harder. We assumed based on what we were told in class that Ada and Prolog would take
the longest, as such we decided to work on one of them together and then give one of us the other one. I took Prolog because I thought it looked
really cool. Dylan did the other 3 in the meantime (he had also already done 2 before we decided to partner which made it much easier). Because Ruby and Haskell were already done 
when we were allocating work, we decided to split it up where I take prolog, we split Ada, and Dylan took C# and whoever had more time did Scheme.
