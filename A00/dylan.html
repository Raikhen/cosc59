**A00 - Comparing Languages**

<!--

General
========

For each of your team's implementations, explain the following (where appropriate and applicable):

- details on calling conventions, input and output data formats, limitations, bugs, and special features.
- negative aspects of your program (limitations, known bugs)
- positive aspects (extensions, special features)
- describe your choice of modularization (abstractions), data structures, and algorithms
- explain anything you did that is likely to be different from what other students may have done
- justify any design decisions for which the rationale isn't immediately clear

Feel free to modify the structure of this `readme.html` file to fit the current assignment and to fit how you wish to present your findings.

Prime Partitions
=================

42 has 15 prime partitions, and they are:

42 = 19 + 13 + 5 + 3 + 2 (5)

42 = 19 + 11 + 7 + 3 + 2 (5)

42 = 17 + 13 + 7 + 3 + 2 (5)

42 = 37 + 3 + 2 (3)

42 = 17 + 11 + 7 + 5 + 2 (5)

42 = 29 + 11 + 2 (3)

42 = 23 + 17 + 2 (3)

42 = 23 + 11 + 5 + 3 (4)

42 = 19 + 13 + 7 + 3 (4)

42 = 19 + 11 + 7 + 5 (4)

42 = 17 + 13 + 7 + 5 (4)

42 = 37 + 5 (2)

42 = 31 + 11 (2)

42 = 29 + 13 (2)

42 = 23 + 19 (2)



Implementations
================

I implemented the prime partitions program in Ruby, C#, Haskell, and Scheme.
Sebastian and I worked together on the Ada version and Sebastian did the Prolog version on his own.
I first coded the Ruby version and then used it as a source of inspiration for the other imperative languages: C# and Ada.
For the functional languages, I first did it in Haskell and then did it in Scheme.
I tried my best to respect the naming conventions of each language.
My code is very, very far from being efficient.
Instead of obtaining the primes by doing something relatively fast like the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
I just made a function to check if a number is prime
(that in some cases runs in O(n) instead of O(sqrt(n)) just to keep it as simple as possible).
I didn't even store the values, so the function to get a bounded list of primes is computed every time.
I did it this way because it was more than sufficient to obtain the prime partitions of 42 and
I didn't want to needlessly complicate things.

I tried to keep the code relatively modular by defining functions/methods even if
there was only one other function that called it to make the code as clear as possible.
The only cases where I see I could have done a better job modularizing the code is
in printing the partitions on both functional languages.
Another thing I could have done differently is to actually write the C# program
using OOP by making a class called prime partition.
However, that seemed kind of silly considering the simplicity of the program.

Language: Ada
--------------------------------

At first, Sebastian and I tried to store the partitions as matrix of booleans
where each entry tells you if a given prime is/isn't in a given partition.
However, this proved to be a terrible idea.
In particular, I really disliked the fact that we had to "guess" one of the dimensions of the matrix
since it's tricky to upper-bound the number of prime partitions.
Once we switched to using vectors, everything turned out to be quite easy.
