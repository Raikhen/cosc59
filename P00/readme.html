Domain
=================

The domain of our problem is climbing systems, i.e.,
the set of tools, techniques, and practices used to stay (relatively) safe while climbing.
An expert in our domain would be a rock climbing guide:
somebody who can solve tough situations that arise while climbing.
A regular user of our domain would be a climber who wants to learn new techniques
or improve their climbing systems knowledge in an interactive way.

Problem
================

<!--
The problem that we want to solve is to write a language that can take
a series of actions in a climbing scenario and output the resulting state.

The problem of our project focuses on creating a language that can parse a climbing scenario given a description of events in the form of 
'objects' and 'actions' and output a described result state of the scenario. Our aim is to generate singular descrpitions of end-states
for climbing scenarios after parsing the input.
-->

The problem of our project focuses on creating a language that can parse a climbing scenario given a
description of a starting scenario and the series actions/events that took place. This would allow us to

1. Find solutions to technical climbing problems.
2. Generate diagrams of climbing systems that could be used for educational purposes.
3. Verify that a given solution for a problem makes sense which could also be used for educational purposes.

<!--
The problem of our project will deal with the creation of a program that can parse a climbing 'scenario' and output a 'solution' in the form of
an order set of actions that effectively deal with the scenario. Our aim is to generate singular solutions given generated scenarios which we
will write and determine if a user free-response input matches the computed solution or not. 

An example 'scenario' in non-code terms that we may use is how to clean a 'sport' climbing route on rappel.
For reference: A 'sport' climbing route is a route with permanent bolted anchors and protection.

Our scenario may resemble the following: if a climber is at the top of a sport climbing route and desires to clean the route by rapelling with a 
standard rapel kit, how should they go about this action?
-->

A verbose version of a possible input, representing the series of actions somebody can take to clean a route on rappel,  could look like the following

1. Clip into the anchor with a PAS
2. Add a backup
3. Hitch the 'sharp' end of the rope to something to prevent it from falling
4. Untie from the rope
5. Pull the rope through both rings of the anchor until reaching the midpoint
6. Tie knots in both ends of the rope
7. Throw both ends of the rope down
8. Check for snags
9. Pull up slack from the rope
10. Attach an extended ATC device to the rope.
11. Attach a 'friction hitch' to the rope
12. Attach the hitch to the climber via a locking carabiner
13. Pull in slack such until the climber weights the system
14. Detach PAS and backup
15. Slowly and carefully lower oneself down
16. Pause at each 'quickdraw' and detach it from the wall
17. After reaching the ground, detach oneself from the rope by undoing the earlier systems
18. Untie the knots in both ends of the rope
19. Pull the rope down from one side until it falls.

Then, the program would output the final state of the scenario,
which would be the climber at the bottom of the route with the rope on the ground but
showing a list of tips/things to improve which would include attaching the friction hitch
used for the third hand before clipping the ATC.

Also, when the input to the program requests it, the program would output a diagram of the final state or a digram per action taken.

**Input**

`verbose`

**Output**

`The climber "basty" is at the top of "Lulu", "cloved" into a "quad" anchor.`

Functionality
================

First of all, the type of output depends on the input type.
The input type can be either `verbose`, `code`, or `diagram`.
If it's verbose, the output is a human-readable explanation of
the resulting scenario. If it's code, the output is more easily
read by a computer than by a human. If it's diagram, the output is
a diagram that depicts the final scenario.
The output will be determined by processing each "primitive" action one by one.
By primitive action we mean actions that are not composed of other actions.
