Assignment Reflection
======================

List comprehensions are pretty neat, it was cool to see Haskell's lazy/leftmost evaluation in action.

<!--
How do the languages compare to one another?
Which language was your favorite?  Which was your least favorite?
What type of problems would each language be good at solving?
When you had a choice of language, why did you decide on the language in which you implemented your solution?
If you worked with a partnor, how did you decide to split up the work?
